<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Chencheng Cai (蔡陈骋) </h2>
I am an applied scientist in the Turing team at Microsoft. Before that, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Washington State University. I finished my postdoc in the Department of Statistics, Operations and Data Science, Fox School of Business at Temple University, advised by Dr. [Edoardo Airoldi](https://airoldi.github.io). I received Ph.D. in Statistics (advised by Dr. [Rong Chen](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/rongchen/)) from Rutgers University and B.S. in Physics and Computer Softwares from Peking University. 

My research lies in the areas of causal inference, matrix factorization , nonparametric approaches and Monte Carlo methods with emphases in both theoretical analysis and novel methodologies.
