Research Projects 
=====
* Theoretical properties of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for causal inference in the presence of interference from a perspcetive of sampling and the optimal designs along with a sample size calculation. 
* The optimal randomized saturation design for total treatment effect under interference using the difference-in-means estimator and the optimal deterministic stauration design.
* Matrix factorization and approxmation using Kronecker products with automated determined configuratons. 
* Effecient Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for constrained sampling problem and for high-dimensional optimizations though state-space emulation. 
* Individualized Group Learning: individualized/personalized inference from a heterogenuous population.
